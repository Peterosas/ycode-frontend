# TOTAL TIME SPENT ON THE ASSIGNMENT
Though the assignment isn't completed base on the instruction stated below... I did spend about 4hrs.

I was on a journey when I received your email, so I couldn't give the required amount of attention.

I do hope I would be in your team to prove myself more to you.

If you do permit me, I can still push the complete assignment here on github tomorrow by 8pm Nigeria time.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this interview.

# ycode front-end test
Hi! Are you ready to join our team working on an innovative and exciting project? We are looking for a Front-end Developer (Vue 3).

For the test assignment, we would like you to create a simple no-code tool that can manipulate layers on a responsive "canvas".

There are 5 main functions we want to be able to perform:

- The canvas must be able to have multiple layers at one time.
- The text inside each layer should be uniquely editable.
- Each layer can be deleted uniquely from the canvas.
- Design for each layer can be affected individually.
- Ability to change text size, background color and opacity using Tailwind.

Tech specs:
- Use Vuex to manage state.
- No typescript.
- Only use vanilla JS when really needed, everything in the task list is achievable 100% with only Vue.

We have provided a base HTML layout for your application. The final result should be achieved without the use of any plugins / libraryâ€™s.
 
It is key for this application to be user-friendly.
 
Use small commits and descriptive commit messages while working on the assignment. One commit solving one issue.

Do not spend more than 5 hours on this assignment. This should be more than enough time to complete the given tasks. Please specify in your README.md
how much time you did spend completing this assignment.
